Template for Thesis at Temple University
========================================

Introduction
------------

Since the graduate school does not provide a latex template, I thought I would 
create one and share it with everyone to help cut down on the tedious task of 
formatting your thesis.

This work is based off of the very nicely documented [Purdue University 
thesis](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/)
class by [Mark Senn](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/). Please thank him.

Ideally the Temple University Grad School would maintain and update with their 
latest formatting requirements (since almost everybody uses latex). Perhaps if 
enough people ask for latex templates they will make one or we could shame them 
into maintaining this one.

A few things to note:
 - Currently only correct formatting for physics or "hard sciences",
   (sorry, feel free to modify the code for your discipline).
 - Last updated to follow 2015 [Dissertation and Thesis 
   Handbook](http://www.temple.edu/dissertationhandbook/index.htm)
 - This has only been used on Linux.  If you find bugs, please fix and/or 
   report them via [github](https://github.com/whit2333/tuthesis) or 
   [email](whit@temple.edu).

The Template
------------

In the template folder you will find a very nice starting point for your 
thesis.
